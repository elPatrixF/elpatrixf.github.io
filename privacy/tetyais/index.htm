<h1>About Location use.</h1>
<p>This game uses the Bluetooth File Transfer extension, which due to the way it's implemented requires the following permissions. <code>android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</code><br>
Despite this, this game does NOT access the GPS for your location, it does not access your location in the background, and the game can be fully played without geolocation.<br>
The bluetooth extension is used for local multiplayer functionality.
